Assumptions:
1. We are assuming that our project will start from a welcome page, and then other respective pages.
Design and Layout: The static web pages that display information on artists, albums, and songs are created as part of the web portal's main interface using HTML and CSS. The online portal's design and layout shall adhere to contemporary web design standards and be aesthetically pleasing, accessible, and user-friendly.

Static Content: Information about the artists, albums, and songs that are presented on the web pages is static and does not change dynamically or in real-time. There is no need for user-generated content or data input since the content is delivered as static text and images.

Browser Compatibility: It is expected that the web portal has been developed to work with current web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge. It is not seen to be necessary to support older or less popular web browsers.

Responsive: This Website is NOT responsive. So it work for Given 1920 X 1080 screen pixels. It may work for some other screens But cannot guarantee
We have created an album page with all of the albums by all of the artists from which we can access the album pages of specific artists by clicking on their names; additionally, if we click on any album, we can access the song pages for that album immediately.

And in Song page we have list of all Songs of all Albums of all Artist. Nothing in this page is clickable (except header and footer)
For hovering of navigation bar of home page, first scroll up fully.
